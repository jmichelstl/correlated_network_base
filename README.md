# correlated_network_base
This code uses information about lattice structure, bond dilution fraction and structural correlation to create a geometric and topological description of an elastic network with Lee-Edwards boundary conditions.

This project is meant to be compiled on Unix-based systems. Apart from standard libraries, this project depends on the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL). Once
you have installed the GSL, compilation should be as simple as "make corrnet".
